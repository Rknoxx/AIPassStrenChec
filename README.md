# AI Based Password Stregth Checker

AIPassPro is a simple Python project to check the _strength of passwords_.  
It not only shows whether a password is strong or weak, but also checks how many _data breaches_ are linked with weak passwords.  
The project also demonstrates how to create _hashed passwords_ that are difficult to crack.

## Features
- Check password strength
- Identify if weak passwords have appeared in data breaches
- Generate secure hashed passwords
- Easy to use and extend
- Future plan: convert into an app that works like a password manager

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rknoxx/AIPassStrenChec.git
   cd AIPassPro
   
## Run the Script
2. python AIPassPro.py

## Future Improvements
1. Build as a full application (with user interface)
2. Add password manager features
3. Enhance breach detection with APIs
